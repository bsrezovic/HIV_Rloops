This folder contains materials and code pertaining to paper:

"Aquarius helicase facilitates HIV-1 integration into R-loop enriched genomic regions".

Most of the code is built upon previous work by Maja Kuzman and Dunja Glava≈°, and can be found here;
https://github.com/MaKuzman/IS_mapping
https://zenodo.org/records/7529755
Simulating random genomic fragments was done as described by Greg Bedwell; 
https://gbedwell.github.io/random-genome-fragments/

Folders raw_integrations_1 and 2 contain the raw sequencing data for the HIV integration sites.
The respective metadata sheets for the samples are in NGS_Metadata_Sheet_1 and 2.
The folder "integration_analysis_scripts" contains the trimming/fltering/mapping bash scripts.

The "code" folder contains;

Random_insertions.R - code for making the random integration sites to compare with actual integration site data along with the code for making the comparison graphs.
MapInts.R - code for mapping the integration site data we get from the raw sequencing files onto the genome and comparing that data to previous data for rloop positions

The "Graphs" folder contains code relating to various figures included in the paper.
